        <h3>Project Overview</h3>
        <p>
          Inspired by the user experience of Uber Eats, this independent UX
          research project explores how food delivery apps can enhance their
          features. Through conducting interviews and focus groups with Uber
          Eats users, I identified common patterns and frustrations in the food
          delivery experience. Based on these insights, I designed potential
          UI/UX solutions to improve the usability and efficiency of the Uber
          Eats app.

            <ul>
              <li>
                Due to concerns for budget, some users feel anxious when opening
                the app and spend a lot of time deciding on what to order
              </li>
              <li>
                Users often reorder from the same restaurants, because they feel
                safer to do so and could also spend less time browsing and
                deciding

                Most users want to avoid interaction with the delivery person

                Price is usually the main factor that influences the users’

          <h3>Examining Assumptions</h3>
          <p>
            Through the interviews, I was able to gain information that deepened
            my understanding of the user experience in these areas.

                Interviewees almost always reorder from stores they’ve tried
                before so this assumption is close to being accurate. They
                express that it’s more convenient and “easier to pick out what
                to order”, also feeling that it’s “safer to stick with them”. By
                making the previous restaurants more visible and easier to get
                to, could bring convenience to the users and help with their
                decisions.

                This assumption is true, the interviewees always choose the
                “Leave at location” drop-off option, because they “don’t want to
                greet people”. Sometimes, if the delivery person is new to the
                city or to Uber Eats, they may not be able to find the address
                and would call the interviewees which makes them feel stressed.
                Enabling users to give clearer instructions to address and
                reducing direct contact could make them less stressed during the
                delivery.

                Most interviewees spend a lot of time deciding on their order,
                but it mostly comes from the concerns for prices and fees, not
                the variety of stores, so this is not very accurate. Price is
                the most important thing for the interviewees and they feel
                “anxious” or “guilty” due to the thought of spending money.
                Always showing clear prices and all the fees that comes with the
                delivery, may make it easier for users to navigate through the
                app as well as being more confident in their decisions.

          <h3>Goals & Vision</h3>
          <p>
            After the research, the main thing I found out is that many
            interviewees have concerns with price and often take a lot of time
            to choose their orders, as well as some frustrations towards the
            delivery process. My goals are:

              <p>
                Although being indecisive may be a personal issue, but through
                some adjustments of how the content is presented and new
                features on the browsing areas, we could potentially simplify
                users’ decisions and enable them to find what they want
                effortlessly.

              <p>
                Having to greet or interact with the delivery person may be
                frustrating and stressful for some users. Uber Eats has a very
                nice drop-off option to leave the delivery at door, but there
                will still be times when issues occur and interactions are
                needed. Through changes in the UX design of the option, we could
                minimize these occurrences and create a stress-free experience
                for users.
